Software
=========

Miscellaneous software associated with the project. Max 7 is not here, because it is
a commercial product, however free alternitaves can be used to transmit MIDI siginals
to the robots.

###Composition Software
A great (meaning free and open-source) program for writing sheet music is [Musescore](https://musescore.org/).

Any Carnegie Mellon students also have access to the Music Technology computer cluster, located in Margaret Morrison room 119A. The cluster is equipt with mac computers that are all hooked up to MIDI interfaces and pianos. The computers are nstalled with a lot of useful composition and MIDI sequencing software such as Garage Band, Logic, Reason, Ableton Live, Audacity, Spear, and Max 7. The lab hours for the cluster are posted on the door.
