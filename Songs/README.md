###Guidelines for Composing/Arranging for the Orchestra

When writing music for the orchestra, the most important thing is to keep the ranges of the instruments in mind. Xylobot has a range of C4-E5, which corresponds to a MIDI range of 60-76. Bassbot is a non pitched instrument, and can only play rhythms written on C2, or MIDI 36. Bassbot is similar, and can only play rhythms written on D2, or MIDI 38. If one of the robots encounters a note that is out of its range, it will simply ignore it, and play a rest.

MIDI files can be created using a variety of software. Finale is useful if you want to type notes directly into the staff, and it makes it easy to export separate MIDI tracks for each instrument. Finale is available in the Music Technology cluster at CMU in Maragaret Morrison 119A. A free alternative to Finale you can also try is Musescore. 

If you're feeling daring you can also try composing something for the orchestra using Max 7. Max is a powerful drag and drop music programming language, that also you to manipulate MIDI data directly, and can be used to generate random MIDI values in a range, create and record sequences and lots lots more. There is a tutorial under the 'help' header in the program, and the section on MIDI can help you get started. Max 7 can be downloaded as a 30 day trial from the Cycling '74 website, and is also available in the Music Technology cluster at CMU.
