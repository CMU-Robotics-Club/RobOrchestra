This is a collection of the songs that the orchestra has practiced or is learning. Anyone who wishes to compose or arrange for the orchestra may upload their MIDI file to this folder of the Github.

###Guidelines for Composing/Arranging for the Orchestra

When writing music for the orchestra, the most important thing is to keep the ranges of the instruments in mind. Xylobot has a range of C4-E5, which corresponds to a MIDI range of 60-76. bassBot is a non pitched instrument, and can only play rhythms written on C2, or MIDI 36. Similarly, snareBot can only play on MIDI 38 and tomBot can only play on MIDI 37. If one of the robots encounters a note that is out of its range, it will simply ignore it, and play a rest.

MIDI files can be created using a variety of software. Finale is useful if you want to type notes directly into the staff, and it makes it easy to export separate MIDI tracks for each instrument. Finale is available in the Music Technology cluster at CMU in Maragaret Morrison 119A. A free alternative to Finale you can also try is Musescore.
